Current phase: 1
Gate mode: MANUAL
Last green commit: 6684ef3

## Phase 0: Discovery, Foundation, and Free-Stack Proof

- [x] Read requirements docx and master prompt; inspect empty repo
- [x] Create state files (PROGRESS, DECISIONS, OPEN_QUESTIONS, .env.example)
- [x] Write docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- [x] Record verified free-tier limits in DECISIONS.md
- [x] Scaffold monorepo (workspaces, tsconfig, eslint, prettier, vitest, CI)
- [x] Add netlify.toml, API Dockerfile, deploy/docker-compose.yml
- [x] Implement GET /api/health with passing test (verify: `npm test`, `docker compose up`, curl OK)
- [x] Implement placeholder web page with passing test (`App.test.tsx`)
- [x] Free-stack proof: Neon connect + trivial migration — documented "needs credentials"; `db:proof` ready (OPEN_QUESTIONS 15)
- [x] Free-stack proof: arm64 image build (built `linux/arm64`, Chromium 156 launches `--version`)
- [x] Headless Chromium render smoke — documented "needs real arm64 VM"; QEMU hangs locally (OPEN_QUESTIONS 20)
- [x] Run gate checklist and write docs/phase-reports/PHASE-0.md

## Phase 1: Database and Authentication

- [x] Audit existing Phase 1 snapshot against requirements and identify fixes
- [x] Verify full data-model migrations and single-master seed behavior
- [x] Verify login, OTP, password-change, member-management, and origin protection
- [x] Verify rate limiting, generic errors, lockout, and secret-safe logging
- [x] Verify mock and Hostinger SMTP adapters, including status verification (real SMTP needs credentials)
- [x] Verify login and app-shell UI requirements
- [x] Run lint, typecheck, test, and build; resolve Phase 1 regressions
- [x] Complete acceptance-criteria and secret review; document credential blockers
- [x] Write docs/phase-reports/PHASE-1.md and commit completed Phase 1 work (commit 6684ef3)
